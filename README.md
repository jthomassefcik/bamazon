# Welcome to the Bamazon Marketplace

1. Here you can see where the app asks a user to choose a product to purchase.

1. We select fidget spinner > the app asks how many and we choose 10.
    1. Notice in the DB there are 98 spinners @ $3.00 each.

1. Now you will see that the user is shown total of $30 for their 10 fidget spinners @ $3.00 each and the DB reflects an decrease of 10 spinners from 98 to 88.

1. Therefore if we try and purchase 89 spinners in the next go... We are told there are only 88 in stock and we must update our order.

I could not figure out how to print the customer instructions after the new inquirer prompt following each order. I would fix that with more time.
